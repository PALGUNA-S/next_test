                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>When you transact with a buyer for exports, you get an invoice (account receivable) that includes <MuiLink href={'/export-payment-terms'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">payment terms for your exports.</MuiLink> You can then sell this invoice to a bank or financial institution at a discount. This process is known as factoring.
                                    Instead of waiting for the buyer to pay, the seller—in this case, the exporter—transfers the risk and onus of collecting payment to the bank or financial institution. The exporter does this by submitting the invoice and other documents like the <MuiLink href={'/what-is-letter-of-credit'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">letter of credit</MuiLink> and <MuiLink href={'/what-is-bill-of-exchange'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">bill of exchange</MuiLink> (if available) to authenticate the transaction.  The price the exporter has to pay is the difference between the discounted amount and the total amount due on the bill.

Sale: </b>Typically, the process starts when the exporter sells their products or services to an international buyer on credit terms. An invoice with payment terms extending from 1 month to 3 months will be generated in most instances.</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b style={{ fontWeight: '500' }}>2.	Factoring agreement: </b>Since the payment will take a while, the exporter will reach an agreement with a bank or financial institution on the terms for factoring. The factoring agreement will include terms like the discount rate and portion of the invoice value offered in advance.</Typography>

Collection: </b>In such an export factoring arrangement, the factoring entity will take on the activities and responsibilities related to collecting the amount due on the invoice.

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>One of the main benefits of export factoring is the immediate release of funds to the exporter, which enables them to keep their operations running. Apart from this, there is the mitigation of risks that exporters face due to delays in payment or non-payment. The extent to which the risk will be mitigated will depend on the exporter's agreement with the bank or financial institution. </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>Another benefit of export factoring is transferring collection ownership from the exporter to the financial institution or the bank. By offering ready access to working capital and removing the responsibility of collections, factoring helps the exporter focus on their core business. </Typography>

                                                    In this case, the exporter will retain some risk if the buyer does not pay the invoice.

                                                    This type of factoring will cost less since the exporter also has the onus of collecting dues if the buyer defaults on the payment.

                                                    The factoring entity will shoulder the entire responsibility for the collection and take on non-payment risk.

                                                    Since the factoring entity is responsible for the collection, it may charge higher fees or offer a lesser percentage of the invoice amount.
