                  Purpose Codes are necessary while making <MuiLink href={'https://www.leremitt.com/fintech-cross-border-remittance-revolution'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover">cross-border remittances</MuiLink> or receiving payments. They are alphanumeric unique codes assigned by a particular country's Central Bank (Reserve Bank of India) and are assigned for each distinct type of transaction involving payment of or receipt in foreign currencies.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  Banks use the purpose codes for regulatory reporting, and you must get them right. The purpose codes can be found in various  <MuiLink href={'https://www.leremitt.com/essential-documents-for-cross-border-trade-guide'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover">documents of cross-border trade.</MuiLink> You should always check which code matches the reason for your remittance closest to the one before you mention the details.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  Bank reporting based on the purpose codes is a source of information to regulators about remittances sent or received under categories such as Overseas Direct Investment (ODI), Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) or Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), respectively.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  International Payments impact forex flowsâ€”both in and out of the country. The correct Purpose Codes are of great consequence in allowing the Government of India to analyze the reasons behind the inflows and outflows of foreign currency to and from India, respectively, and to grasp the situation to ensure that the country is broadly following the roadmap as per governmental policies.

                  Every cross-border international payment in India is subject to rules governed by RBI and the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999 (FEMA). The Indian exporter or importer who originates the transaction based on which the international payment is made is duty-bound to assign the applicable purpose code. This purpose code is mentioned in the SWIFT MT103 message in the Field.

                  It is easy to detect and prevent remittances connected to international money laundering and other fraudulent activities and practices â€“ financial or otherwise, as remittances need to be accompanied by particular Purpose Codes.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  The RBI has two lists based on whether the remittance will be treated as a receipt or payment in India. Purpose codes for Inward Remittances have codes starting with "P," and outward remittances have codes beginning with "S." You need to choose the Purpose Code from the list as per the nature of your remittance.

                  You need to choose the transaction by matching the purpose with the list. It may be an advance payment for international trade-related activity, for goods and services, for deposits in the accounts of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) for their savings accounts or fixed deposits, or any of many other defined purposes.

                  You must ensure that your Purpose Code meets international regulations and RBI guidelines. Any discrepancy may be flagged as a deliberate attempt to engage in tax evasion. Your transaction may fail, and even if successful, the funds may be placed under freeze, thus preventing you from accessing them. Any flagged-off attempts at tax evasion or money laundering will result in further investigation by different investigative authorities.

                  If you unwillingly mention the wrong purpose code in your invoice or your instruction to your bank, speak to your corresponding overseas importer or bank to amend it within permissible timelines.

                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  A large number of exporters are neither highly educated nor very savvy. They fail to understand the regulatory requirements around accurate purpose codes and the implications of not complying with them. As a result, they unintentionally violate rules and face the consequences of their actions.

                  The list provided by the RBI is exhaustive, but exporters often find it challenging to identify the precise categories. This increases regulatory scrutiny, long delays, fines, and other financial penalties.
