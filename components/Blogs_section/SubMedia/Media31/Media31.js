                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>1. Compliance: </b>Since EDPMS keeps tabs on export transactions you can ensure that there
                                    is compliance with international trade regulations, managing export quotas, issuance of
                                    licenses, and adhering to restrictions. It also tracks export shipments with detailed time
                                    for processing, approvals, and other export-related issues.

                                    the stakeholders in the process are updated. It makes the electronic filing of exportrelated documents with the customs, reduces the manual aspect of paperwork, and

                                    export poses more risks and the export data processing and monitoring system (EDPMS)
                                    will help mitigate risks in the export process. It puts compliance checks in place to deal
