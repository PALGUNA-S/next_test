                  In today's global marketplace, international trading has become vital to shaping the landscape and improving a country's economic development. However, to facilitate these <MuiLink href={'https://www.leremitt.com/essential-documents-for-cross-border-trade-guide'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover">cross-border trades,</MuiLink>  a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) came into existence that facilitates the efficient exchange of goods and services by reducing the barriers to trade, such as tariffs and import quotas. Let's delve into the intricate world of FTAs and explore their impact on India's growth and competitiveness.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}> The FTA, or a Free Trade Agreement, is a treaty signed between two or more countries to reduce the barriers to investment and trade, such as tariffs, import quotas, and some regulations. The primary aim of an FTA is to increase trade between the signatory countries. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) play a crucial role in reshaping modern global trade.</Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}> FTAs are often implemented through a formal and mutual agreement between the nations involved. FTAs also play an important role in strengthening the bond between countries. They reshape international trade dynamics, with examples like NAFTA (now USMCA) stimulating trade among the US, Canada, and Mexico. FTAs encourage foreign direct investments (FDI), which helps in capital flow and employment creation.</Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>a. FTA eliminates tariffs on goods traded between member countries by making the products affordable.</Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>b. Protects Investment.</Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>FTAs encourage businesses in member countries to focus on producing and selling the goods that best use their resources while other businesses import scarce or unavailable goods domestically. As every country produces selected goods at lower costs, FTAs increase the production and consumption of internationally traded goods. They also facilitate the mix of local production and foreign trade, which, in turn, helps economies boost growth.</Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>However, FTAs are only sometimes guaranteed wins; they can both create opportunities and Boxert trade. FTAs must be thoughtfully designed to enhance complementarities among partner countries and overcome regulatory hurdles to harness their full potential. In the case of India, these agreements have played a strategic role in boosting competitiveness on the global stage. However, challenges remain, particularly in negotiations with the US and EU nations.</Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>India has been a hub for outsourcing and manufacturing for a while now. So far, India has signed 13 Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs)/Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with various countries/regions. At regional and bilateral levels, India's FTAs span a wide spectrum of contracts with countries. Over the last two years, the Indian government has encouraged trade with enthusiasm to give the economy a needed boost. India actively negotiates and signs FTAs with regions like ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea.</Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>According to recent statistics, the India-ASEAN FTA has helped to boost India's exports to ASEAN countries by 26%. The India-Japan EPA has helped to boost India's exports to Japan by 20%. The India-UAE CEPA is expected to increase India's exports to the UAE by 10%. Additionally, free trade agreements between India and other countries strongly encourage export-based manufacturing within India. India is also working on FTAs with different countries and regions, including The European Union, The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), The Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and Israel.</Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The recent review of negotiations took place during the meeting between Indian PM Narendra Modi and UK PM Rishi Sunak and the G20 Summit in Delhi. They reviewed the progress of the Free Trade Agreement negotiations. They expressed hope that the remaining issues could be addressed as soon as possible so that a balanced, mutually beneficial, and forward-looking Free Trade Agreement can be concluded. A statement issued by the UK government stated that Sunak repeated the UK's ambition to deliver a landmark trade deal that benefits businesses and workers in both countries and grows bilateral trade in both goods and services.</Typography>
