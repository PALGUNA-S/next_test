                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>In simple terms, both the Nostro and Vostro accounts are similar terms used for the same account with different perspectives.</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The term "Nostro" originates from the Latin phrase "Nostro Signore," which  translates into "Our Account." A Nostro account is a specialised account held by a domestic registered bank with a foreign bank in any foreign currency, the currency of the specific country or geography where the account is maintained.</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>It loosely stands for "our account with them." So, the account that an Indian bank maintains with its American correspondent bank in the United States of America in USD is a Nostro account for the Indian bank. The term "Vostro" originates from the Latin phrase "Vostro Signore," which translates into "Their Account." A Vostro account is an account held by a foreign bank with a domestic bank in domestic currency, the currency of the specific country or geography where the account is maintained. It loosely stands for "their account with us." So, the account that a bank in the European Union, let us say France, maintains with its Indian correspondent bank in India in INR is a Vostro account for the Indian bank.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h2" fontSize={'1.5rem'} fontWeight={400} pb={1}> The History behind Nostro and Vostro Accounts </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>  In today's highly evolved correspondent banking, you will easily be able to access data on the different accounts maintained by <MuiLink href={'https://www.leremitt.com/role-of-exchange-houses-middle-east-remittances-to-india'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover">exchange houses</MuiLink> . But how did such arrangements originate? As per Accounting Historians Journal, the practice of maintaining accounting records in two different currencies in different columns, Lire (our) and Scudi (their), originated from Italian merchants and bankers. Those were the days, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when Venice was at its peak in world trade, and naturally, such commercial refinements originated from there. A lot of banking practices owe their origin to the ones practised in Italy between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>Today, Nostro and Vostro accounts are the backbone of worldwide banking operations and facilitate seamless interaction and payment settlement between domestic and foreign banks and financial institutions. Nostro and Vostro accounts are an integral part of the global cross-border payment ecosystem, as no bank can have its branches in all the countries where it facilitates the transfer of funds. Correspondent banking arrangements are set up to address this issue, but often, even such an arrangement ends up complicating matters. As local branches are not available for settlement, cross-border payments are settled through the Nostro and Vostro accounts. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}> You will recall that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in severe trade and economic sanctions being imposed upon the former country. Russian banks have been barred from participating in the SWIFT network, the global financial messaging system that is the backbone of cross-border payments today. Given this scenario, Russia has been forced to trade with very few countries, India being one of them.</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}> As the SWIFT network is not available for Russian banks, importers are not able to use that route to send their payments. To circumnavigate this blockage and to facilitate trade between INR and Russian Roubles, the Reserve Bank of India has permitted the opening of 20 Special Rupee Vostro Accounts with Russian banks such as Gazprom, Rosbank, Tinkcoff Bank, Centro Credit Bank, and Credit Bank of Moscow in 2023.</Typography>
