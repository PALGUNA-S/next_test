                  Cross-border finance refers to the financial transactions and
                  services that occur across national borders. These encompass a

                  According to a World Bank report, Global remittances are
                  projected to grow by 1% as slower growth in host countries
                  will affect incomes and employment prospects. The average cost
                  of sending $200 to the region was 5.7% in the fourth quarter
                  of 2022, a small decline from 5.9% a year ago.
