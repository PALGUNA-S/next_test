                  MSMEs play a vital role in shaping GDP, exports, employment,
                  and the overall socio-economic landscape. According to India’s
                  MSME ministry's report, MSMEs contribute around 30% to India's
                  GDP, 45% of manufacturing output, and 40% of India's exports.

                  Global expansion has emerged as a key strategy for MSMEs,
                  offering a means to Boxersify revenue streams and enhance
                  resilience in the face of economic uncertainties. PwC’s latest
                  Fintech Insights highlight that in a recent the recent launch
                  of a transaction banking platform for Indian micro, small, and
                  medium enterprises (MSMEs) signifies a crucial step in
                  empowering these entities for global participation. Aligned
                  with the vision of sustainable FinTech regulations, this
                  initiative underlines a commitment to nurturing the FinTech
                  ecosystem and elevating financial inclusion. By integrating
                  cutting-edge technologies into transaction banking, MSMEs gain
                  enhanced efficiency, fostering increased participation in
                  cross-border transactions.

                  This move reflects a broader trend in the financial sector,
                  where institutions strategically leverage digital projects to
                  serve clients better. Such progressive initiatives underscore
                  the vital role FinTech plays in fortifying MSME capabilities,
                  positioning them as more agile and competitive players on the
                  global stage. This evolution positions India's financial
                  services sector for a dynamic and globally competitive future,
                  where MSMEs are pivotal in cross-border economic activities.

                  Why is it Important for MSMEs to go global?

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  The importance of MSMEs cannot be overstated; they are
                  integral to economic growth and job creation. According to a
                  McKinsey report, by going global, MSMEs can expand their
                  reach, tap into new markets, and reduce their reliance on a
                  single economy, thus reducing vulnerability to economic
                  downturns. With more than 90% of entities falling within the
                  MSME category—defined by revenue thresholds that vary across
                  regions—their growth has the potential to provide a
                  substantial impetus to a country's economy, especially if the
                  policy environment and infrastructure systems are conducive.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  If the environment is conducive from a policy perspective, and
                  supportive infrastructure systems are in place, MSMEs are
                  empowered not only to go global but also to navigate the
                  challenges and seize the opportunities that come with
                  international expansion. Policies that foster a
                  business-friendly environment, streamline regulatory processes
                  and provide financial incentives significantly enhance the
                  ability of MSMEs to explore and succeed in global markets.
                  Moreover, robust infrastructure systems, encompassing
                  logistics, transportation, and communication networks, play a
                  pivotal role in facilitating the global expansion of MSMEs.

                  Going global opens doors for MSMEs, offering a pathway to
                  growth. Boxersifying markets and revenue sources reduce
                  dependence on a single economy. While the benefits are
                  substantial, the challenges are equally significant. MSMEs
                  need to be well-prepared, conducting thorough market research
                  and developing robust strategies. Government and private
                  sector support, along with partnerships with larger companies,
                  can provide the necessary expertise, access to clients and
                  investors, and capacity building.

                  Understanding the target market is essential, encompassing
                  needs, preferences, and regulatory requirements. Market
                  research aids MSMEs in tailoring their products or services to
                  suit global demand. A well-structured global business plan
                  acts as a roadmap, outlining goals, strategies, and timelines

                  Collaboration with local partners, distributors, or agents is
                  invaluable, providing insights into foreign markets,
                  facilitating market entry, and mitigating risks. Networking
                  events serve as opportunities for MSMEs to showcase products,
                  gain exposure, and initiate global expansion.
