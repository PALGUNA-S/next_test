                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>A letter of credit (LC) is a financial instrument that a buyer requests and gets from their bank to provide a guarantee of payment to the seller. The LC also details the terms and conditions the seller must meet to get the payment. As you know LC can also help you get financing through <MuiLink href={'/what-is-bill-discounting'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">bill discounting</MuiLink> by providing documentary support.</Typography>

                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>Letters of credit play a significant role in export transactions and when the exporters <MuiLink href={'/accept-international-payments-for-businesses'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">accept international payments.</MuiLink> They assure that the seller is obligated to meet the quality standards, specifications, and delivery time. Through the LC, the buyer guarantees payment to the seller once the transaction is completed. Moreover, it helps with post-shipment finance.</Typography>
                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>Now that we <MuiLink href={'/'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">understand the letter of credit</MuiLink> and its role in inward remittance let’s examine the various types of letters of credit.</Typography>

                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>Letters of credit are financial instruments often used when the transaction is across borders and the seller wants a mechanism that guarantees payment. They can also be used when the transaction is large and complicated, where the specifications are complex and the transaction amount is bigger. In the same way, sellers and buyers prefer an LC when there is a complex transaction with multiple steps involved. Though we covered the process for obtaining an LC in the earlier article, we will now examine the additional nuances of export trade.</Typography>
                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The process starts with an agreement between the exporter (seller) and the importer (buyer) on the specifications, rates, delivery dates, <MuiLink href={'/'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">payment terms,</MuiLink> and other related details. The importer requests an LC be issued from their bank. The LC has all the terms for the transaction and outlines the documents required for payment, shipment dates, and other details.</Typography>
                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The issuing bank sends the LC to the advising bank, which notifies the exporter about the terms outlined in the LC. The exporter accepts the terms, ships the goods, and collates the related documents (commercial invoice, bill of lading, etc.). The seller verifies the documents and presents them to the advising bank.</Typography>
                                    <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The advising bank sends the documents to the issuing bank, which checks and validates the documents and releases payment to the exporter as per the terms of LC. If it’s a deferred LC, then the payment will be made on the specified date. Once the payment is released, the issuing bank hands over the documents to the buyer who can take the delivery of the goods.</Typography>
