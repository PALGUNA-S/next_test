But that is on the revenue side of your business. In this article we will talk about the ways in which you can meet capital requirements for your business. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The government of India has several schemes to provide exporters with <MuiLink href={'/trade-finance-solution'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover" target="_blank">finance trade solutions.</MuiLink> This in many cases may apply to longer-term finance and more towards capital expenditure. As an exporter who sees a gap in the time for payments to land, but have commitments to meet, short-term finance options like bill discounting come in handy.</Typography>

The bank will look at various aspects, including the financial records of the exporter, and discount the bill at an agreed upon rate and provide the funds. </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>In this case, the bill will still be owned by the exporter until payment is received from the buyer. If the buyer fails to make the payment, the onus on paying the amount will be on the exporter. The idea is to take your current asset (in this case a bill or invoice due) and raise funds on it. The banker will examine the authenticity of the document and the transaction and offer an amount that will have service charges and interest deducted from it.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>In bill discounting,  the invoice due becomes an asset that you pledge to raise funds but the ownership lies with you. In that sense, bill discounting seems like a good option. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>The risk in case of bill discounting due to non-payment still lies with you. As the seller, you will need to track the due date and ensure that the payment is made on time or the bank may pursue the amount due from you, making the risk a bit higher. </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>In bill purchase, the risk of non-payment gets transferred to the bank leaving you with space to concentrate on your core business rather than pursuing the buyer for on-time payment.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>In bill discounting, the customer relationship with your buyer remains intact and undiluted as your business will still liaise with the customer for payment details. For long term customers, this option looks more attractive.</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>In bill purchase, your relationship with the buyer can get diluted as the bank will step in to collect the amount due and may handle the entire process differently. If you have a short-term customer you are not sure about, then bill purchase could be the way to go.</Typography>
