                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>Since exporters must go through several steps before a transaction is completed, you are  likely to encounter several invoice formats in the export trade. Each will meet the  requirements of different stakeholders and authorities involved in an export transaction.  Here are the general invoice types.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Proforma invoice </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>This initial invoice is sent to the buyer before the seller ships the goods. It will include
                                    details such as the product details, quality parameters, quantity, and the general terms of
                                    the sale. This invoice is often considered a quotation and indicates the cost the buyer will
                                    incur. The buyer will use this proforma invoice to confirm the order, and it can also be
                                    used by the buyer to get an import license. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Commercial invoice  </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>This primary document has the final list of goods being exported, the price agreed upon,
                                    the terms of the sale, the delivery details, and the payment modalities. The parties
                                    involved in the trade are also included in this invoice, which is also used for customs
                                    clearance as it serves as the transaction proof.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Consular invoice </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>This invoice is certified by the consulate of the buyer or importing country. This
                                    document provides customs with the requisite information to validate the value of the
                                    goods, the quantity, and the nature of the import. This invoice also ensures the correct
                                    taxes and duties are applied to the goods.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Customs invoice</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>This is a document or invoice that the customs authorities in the importing country
                                    require. It contains the information to determine and collect the correct duties and taxes.
                                    Countries with strict import regulations require customs invoices to ensure the right
                                    processes are followed. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}> Certified invoice</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>A designated authority like the Chamber of Commerce must certify the commercial
                                    invoice to confirm the origin of the goods. A certified invoice is often required for the
                                    export of certain products. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Legalized invoice </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>This type of invoice is similar to the certified invoice, but the consulate provides the
                                    validation of the country importing the goods. It is commonly required when exporting to
                                    North Africa and the Middle East countries. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Packing list </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>While this document is not an invoice, it is used along with an invoice to provide a list of
                                    each package's contents. It specifies the weight, length, and other dimensions. The
                                    packing list is required to manage inventory and get customs clearance. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Export license invoice </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>This is an invoice you require when you export goods that require an export license and
                                    has additional information that the licensing authority requires.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}> Combined invoice</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>As the name suggests, the combined invoice consolidates the commercial invoice, the
                                    packing list, and other related information into a single document. It reduces paperwork
                                    and makes the documentation process easier. This can have details like the UTR Number,
                                    among other information.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight={400} fontSize={'1.3rem'} pt={2}>Tax invoice</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>When you export to areas with specific tax regulations, like the EU, you will need the tax
                                    invoice, which includes VAT (value-added tax) details and helps you comply with local tax
                                    authorities' requirements.</Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>As you can see, each invoice type will help you meet the specific requirements of the
