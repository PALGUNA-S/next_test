                                <Typography variant="body1" fontSize={'1.5rem'} fontWeight={400} pb={1}>   Here are some of the types of trade finance available to exporters.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>1. Letter of credit: </b>A letter of credit is the importer or buyerâ€™s bank guaranteeing the exporter that the payment will be made if they meet specific conditions related to the transaction. This can include quality, quantity, and date of delivery of the goods being purchased. Exporters often use the letter of credit (LC) as leverage to get a small-term loan from their bank or financial institution.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>2. Export credit insurance: </b>This type of insurance will protect exporters from the risk of non-payment from international buyers due to any reason. For instance, you have exported to a particular country where the goods have reached, and the importer is happy with the goods. However, they cannot make the payment at once due to political reasons. Insurance will protect your interests in such cases. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>3. Trade loans: </b>As an exporter, you can access trade loans or working capital loans to help with financing your manufacturing, shipping, or other business-related costs. There are specific banks or financial institutions geared specifically to meet the needs of exporters.  </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>4. Invoice or bill discounting: </b>When an exporter gets an invoice or bill promising to pay in the future, they can get these bills discounted by a bank to get short-term finance. <MuiLink href={'https://www.leremitt.com/'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover">Bill discounting</MuiLink> allows exporters to access funds earlier. Then, the bank or financial institution will collect the amount from the buyer when the invoice or bill comes due for payment.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>5. Forfaiting: </b>This involves selling medium or long-term receivables from export-related transactions backed by a bill of exchange or a promissory note. Exporters can get funds upfront and transfer credit risk to the forfaiter.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>6. Guarantee from the bank: </b>A bank can promise the importer to assure them that the exporter will fulfill the contract. The bank will compensate the importer if the exporter fails to deliver the goods of the requisite quality and quantity.</Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}><b>7. Supply chain finance: </b>This financing option comprises various options, including the pre- and post-shipment stages. Supply chain finance helps with various levels, such as procurement, inventory management, logistics, and more. </Typography>

                                <Typography variant="body1" pt={2}>Trade finance helps exporters manage all aspects of the trade by providing financial support.
