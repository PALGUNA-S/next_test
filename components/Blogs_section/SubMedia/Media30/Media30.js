                                    A payment gateway technology helps transmit payment information between a bank and
                                    a merchant. You can use payment gateways to accept and send card-based payments
                                    using debit or credit cards.

                                    A payment aggregator acts as a solution that organizes the payment process from one

                                    payments. Payment aggregators help clients use different types of payment methods like
                                    cards, UPI, e-wallets, and other such options.
