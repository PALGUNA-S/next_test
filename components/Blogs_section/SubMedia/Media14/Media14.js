                                    With the goal to do a full marathon this year, I was asking runners around me on their annual plans so that we could form a support group for each other while training. At the same time, I was drawing parallels between building a successful company and running a marathon. I felt I was at the same spot as 2022 when I started up on my own. Both endeavors – starting up and running a marathon require resilience, collaboration, and a supportive community. Here is how my mind was intersecting the two disparate worlds:

They seek advice from experienced runners, join running clubs, and learn from others’ successes and failures.
