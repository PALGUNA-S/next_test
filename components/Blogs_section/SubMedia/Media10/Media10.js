                  An international payment or a cross-border payment stands for all those transactions where payer and payee are in different countries. Such payments range from the smallest amount you may charge on your credit card on an e-commerce site based abroad to the larger payments, running into millions of USD for the import of machinery.

                  India's merchandise export and import figures (non-petroleum Products) for Financial Year 2023 stood at USD 354 Billion and USD 458 Billion, while Services exports and Imports figures stand at USD 325Bn and USD 180 Billion, respectively. India received USD 125 Billion as Inward Remittance in 2022-23, the highest globally.

                  On one end of the spectrum in international payments, you would have used your credit card to make payments abroad or on any international e-commerce site. The following charges are levied to you for such a transaction, either online or at a Point of Sales (POS) terminal abroad:

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  As the payment will be in a foreign currency on an INR card, the value of the transaction will need to be converted from INR to the relevant foreign currency. Banks charge you up to 3.5 per cent for such conversion.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  This is a fee, typically 1 per cent, charged by the merchant through its service provider for converting the foreign exchange (INR on your card to the local currency). This only applies when you pay the amount in INR rather than the local currency.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>
                  <b>Pro Tip:</b> You can save on this fee by asking the merchant to reject Dynamic Currency Conversion and charge instead in the local currency. During your next visit to Paris, while paying for your espresso and croissant, ask the staff at the caf√© to charge your card in Euro instead of INR. Platforms like PayPal charge 3 per cent for consumers and over 4.4 per cent for merchants above their fixed fees.

                  This is a fixed charge or a charge that varies as per slabs and is on account of the charges the remitting bank has to pay <MuiLink href={'https://www.leremitt.com/understanding-swift-in-global-finance'} rel="noopener noreferrer" color="primary" underline="hover">SWIFT</MuiLink> for utilizing their messaging network. While ordering the payment, the remitter can indicate who will pay the charges. It is usually shown as Beneficiary, Remitter, or Shared. Depending on the option selected - "OUR," "BEN," or "SHA" for the Field 71A of the MT 103 (the SWIFT message) by the remitter, you as the beneficiary will either receive the entire amount or the amount net of these charges. In payment of USD 5000, if the charges are USD 25, and the remitter has chosen the beneficiary option, the remitting bank will send out USD 4975.

                  This is the margin that your bank keeps as a profit on foreign exchange between the prevailing market rate for that foreign currency and what they apply for converting your remittance to INR. This is one of the most opaque components in a remittance, and the margins are often as high as 2 per cent. Unless you are an exporter or receive regular remittances, you will not be able to understand the exact margin charged to you. In our example, if a 2% margin is applied to the prevailing market rate of 82.90 INR for 1 USD, the rate applicable to you will be 81.24.

                  Banks often levy a service fee or a FIRC fee to generate a Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate. This, too, attracts GST @ 18 per cent.

                <Typography variant="body1" pt={1}>

We also assume that the prevailing market rate for 1 USD is 82.90 INR.

                  So, for an original remittance of USD 5000, the beneficiary had to pay INR 12,889.89 as a charge, whichever terminology they were referred to. This stands to be 3.1 per cent of the original amount.
